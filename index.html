            Håvard's creator wants to remain anonymous to avoid getting unwanted
            attention for <i>Håvard the Hover Man</i> and his other remarkable
            creations. However, we can reveal that he is a student at NTNU
            Gløshaugen and that he is very passionate about creating art using
            state-of-the-art tools.

          <p>
            Håvard has been a legend in the stickman community for over two
            weeks. His interests include standing, waving, shouting and being
            hovered. He also follows a strict vegan diet and exercises regularly
            to retain his skinny figure.

      <h2>Documentation</h2>

      <p>
        This website is the first project for the course IT2810 Web Development
        at NTNU. The task was to implement simple web graphics using SVG and
        HTML5 Canvas, including some interactivity and animation. I chose to
        make a stickman that waves his arms when the user hovers over the image.
        I first created this in SVG, and then recreated it in HTML5 Canvas.
      </p>

      <p>
        The code is split into three files; one for HTML, one for CSS and one
        for Javascript. This simplifies the HTML file and makes it easier to
        read.
      </p>

      <div class="flex-text-container">
        <div class="flex-element">
          <h3>Graphics</h3>
          <p>
            The SVG image was created from scratch using standard SVG elements
            such as &lt;line&gt; and &lt;circle&gt;. Animation was done using
            CSS, where you can specify a keyframe defining the start and end
            values of the element you want to animate. I used the CSS property
            <i>transform</i> to rotate the arms back and forth with an angle
            between -35 and 35 degrees, creating the waving effect. I would
            prefer to put the SVG code in a separate file to simplily the HTML
            file, but I believe the SVG has to be inline in order to animate it
            using CSS.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Canvas image was made by placing a canvas element in the HTML,
            and then drawing on it using native Javascript functions. Animation
            was slightly more complicated with Canvas. I used Javascript's
            <i>requestAnimationFrame</i> function, which allows the canvas to
            refresh 60 times a second. <i>requestAnimationFrame</i> also comes
            with a few benefits over the more primitive
            <i>setInterval</i> solution, namely power efficiency and animation
            smoothness. A variable gradually transitioning between values of -35
            and 35 was used as the angle when drawing the arms, enabling the
            waving animation. I also had to calculate how much the angle would
            have to change in each frame in order to match the animation speed
            with the SVG.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-element">
          <h3>Page layout</h3>
          <p>
            The page layout is powered by CSS Flexbox, which is a set of CSS
            properties for creating a flexible and responsive layout. I chose
            Flexbox over CSS Grid because I have more experience with the
            former, and Flexbox also has slightly better browser support. I also
            did not have the need for a granular two-dimensional layout, for
            which Grid is superior.
          </p>

          <p>
            jQuery was used for a number of things in the script, such as
            selecting elements in the DOM, checking if the canvas is hovered,
            registering click listeners and showing/hiding the documentation
            section you are reading right now. In 2022, jQuery is mostly
            obsolete. Most of its features are now implemented natively in
            Javascript and CSS, with good browser support. However, jQuery is a
            very popular library, and lots of older projects still use it to
            this day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cross-browser testing was conducted using Chrome version 104 and
            Safari version 15.6. I have assured that the layout looks identical
            in both browsers and that user interaction works as expected. I have
            mostly used W3Schools and MDN as references for SVG, HTML5 Canvas
            and jQuery. StackOverflow has also been a very useful resource for
            more specific problems. All code is written from scratch, and I have
            not reused any code snippets.
